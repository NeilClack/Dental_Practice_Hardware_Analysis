- Copied all data sources to xlsx sheets. All original csv data remains intact and untouched
- Renamed datetime column to DateTime
- Moved each data collector source to a separate table with the name of the collector source.
- Removed PC name and unnecessary collector information from headings. i.e. \\FRONT2A\Event Tracing for Windows\Total Memory Usage --- Non-Paged Pool
 to Total Memory Usage --- Non-Paged Pool with the sheet name of Event Tracing for Windows
- Repeated all above steps for all four data sources.

- Removed the unrecorded "Networking and Network Interface data"
- Split date and time in PowerBi as this leads to an easier split than Excel. (Results in 2 columns in two steps rather than 4 columns in 4 steps.)
- Changed all counter data from float to integer. While a decimal calculation for X/second is valid, with this amount of data and the granularity being analyzed, having 3.99 faults per second is best represented by 4 instead.
