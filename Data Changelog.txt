- Copied all data files to a new directory "../data_copies/*_original_copy.csv"

*server01 data is missing the correct datetime. I have reached out to the IT representative to obtain fresh copies of this data. It is yet to be determined if this data was stored this way by the computer or if something happened in the transportation of data to cause corruption. Dates and times do not match the date/time of collection. ~3/22/2022 - Neil
