# Dental Practice Hardware Analysis  

## Objective  

The goal of this analysis is to investigate and determine the cause of slowness and freezing in a networked software running in the office. Instances of freezing, lost connections and other issues have been experienced for some time. At this time, all devices that sit along the network path from the server to (and including) the workstation have been replaced except for network cabling.  

To provide an in depth look at the issue, Performance Monitor logs have been collected using custom designed Data Collectors to gather information regarding networking and hardware performance. The office has done their best to record all instances of issues down to the minute in order to compare with any outlying datapoints found during this analysis.
